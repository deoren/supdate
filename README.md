## About

This is a collection of old Visual Basic 6 and Visual C++ 6 code for 
a small project I wrote in 2001. The goal was to mirror MacAfee dat files from a 
public server to an internal one so local clients could sync from that point.

Bandwidth was at a premium and remote connectivity was not always reliable. I am
happy to say that while the code is crude, the small project was a success.

## Status

Static. 

I have no plans to do anything further with this, but I am posting it anyway
just in case it provides some value for someone else.
