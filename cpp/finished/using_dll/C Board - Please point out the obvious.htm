Please point out the obvious</B></P>
<P>Hello all,<BR><BR>I've recently decided to learn C++, and my lack of 
motivation to do so has been that I learned C first. Unfortunately I never 
learned it in depth, and I certainly don't know C++ in depth.<BR><BR>So, yes, 
I'm another newbie.<BR><BR>I have a program which compiles, and works, but if I 
use VC++ 6.0 to compile it, I get ESP errors. I've done quite a bit of looking 
around the net, and I keep coming back to what the compiler tells 
me.<BR><BR>******************************************<BR>The value of ESP was 
not properly saved across a <BR>function call. This is usually a result of 
calling<BR>a function declared with one calling convention with<BR>a function 
pointer declared with a different 
calling<BR>convention.<BR>******************************************<BR><BR>I've 
attached the source file so everyone can see what I'm talking about. 
<BR><BR>That's a bit cryptic for me, but some of you I'm sure it's 
obvious.<BR><BR>Here is a couple things I do know:<BR><BR>* This program 
properly compiles<BR>* This program properly executes once compiled (and linked) 
using DevCpp 4 or DevCpp beta 5 w/mingw32<BR>* The program will compile and link 
with MS VC++ 6.0, but will NOT execute properly.<BR>* I'm using 
URLDownloadToFile API, and LoadLibrary along with all other required functions 
for that concept to work.<BR><BR><BR>I originally used urlmon.lib to link with a 
previous project with VC++ 6.0, but I wanted to develop this application (this 
source file is just a small module of a larger project I'm translating, it's 
actually just one function) to use API calls from dlls rather than compiling 
using implicit linking and extra header files.<BR><BR>DevCpp wouldn't compile 
too well with the old method. It now compiles flawlessly.<BR><BR>I just don't 
understand everything that is going on. I really don't understand why VC 6.0 is 
complaining like it is.<BR><BR>I apologize for the length of the post, but I'm 
new and a bit flustered with all of the time I've spent trying to figure it out. 
C++ can be kinda' daunting...<BR><BR>Thanks.<BR><BR>~ DM<BR><BR>If anyone can 
look at the attached file and give me some hints as to what's going on, I would 
greatly appreciate 
it.<BR><BR>------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>As 
of March 14, 2003, this problem has been fixed. Download new source and/or read 
the following posts to see fix for problem. Thanks for everyone's help.</P>

<P>Cool.<BR><BR><BR>I just did get finished printing out the API requirements

was wondering about...<BR><BR><BR>(__stdcall * 
MYPROC)(long,LPCTSTR,LPCTSTR,DWORD,long);<BR><BR><BR>In the above... we're 
making MYPROC a pointer to ... or rather a function pointer?<BR><BR>Which will 
pass the values (prototyped for it above?) to the function?<BR><BR>I've been 
spending the last couple days "just getting it done" without fully grasping what 
I was doing. It sorta' looked right, but why I couldn't tell 
anyone...<BR><BR>But anyway, I appreciate your response, and as you reported, it 
does work great. Thanks so much for taking the time to look at it.<BR><BR>Oh, 
feel free to make any comments on the code, including better ways to do 
something if you wish.<BR><BR>Again, thanks!</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Wel....your own reservations aside - your 
right!!!<BR><BR>Windows APIS almost all use STDCALL......but C compilers default 
to the C calling convention..<BR><BR>When you call a function, the params are 
copied to the stack......The main difference between the conventions is that 
with STDCALL, the called function wipes them off the stack....but with the C 
convention, the code that called the function does this right after the function 
returns.....so in your case, the called function didnt clean up, neither did the 
calling code, therefore the stack still had the params on it.....the debug 
version of your code checks to see that the stack is in the state it should be, 
and as it isnt, it asserts - creating the error

I'm getting it...</B></P>
<P>Cool. That's making a lot more sense. So it's a way to implement in C++, 
what's actually going on at a lower level, right? So basically when you say it's 
not a particular language convention, you're saying that it's the way that any 
language works with the stack?<BR><BR>Forgive me if I'm assuming too 
much...<BR><BR>Also, what does the </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><FONT class=sf>code:</FONT><HR> add esp,4 <HR></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT class=nf>do? How does it set the stack back to normal? 
When you called the function by C calling conventions, does it alter the stack 
by 4? Such as taking 4 away?<BR><BR>BTW, I really appreciate you taking time to 
reply to my posts. I feel like I'm getting a lot out of them! <IMG alt=""

<P>Ok...in my code above I push a 4 byte value (actually a 32bit pointer to a 
string) onto the stack....the stack pointer is held in the ESP register for 
Intel type chips...tht register is decreased 4 bytes as you have added 4 bytes 
to the stack....after this param is no longer needed, the ADD instruction 
increases the ESP register by 4 (bytes) therefore returning the stack position 
to the same place before the CALL
